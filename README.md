# IDS 702 Final Project: Data Science & STEM Salaries

In this project we aim to investigate the factors influencing salaries in Data Science and STEM related jobs, taking into account of the heterogeneity of compensation across locations and companies. After fitting a hierarchical linear regression model, results show that position title, years of experience, years at current company, gender, race, and education are all associated significantly with salary, with random variations based on the state and company of employment.
